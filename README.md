Peptide mapper: .py file to map mode #1 phosphosites identified by MaxQuant to genetically encoded phosphosites. Enables mapping peptides with localized pSer to phosphosites with pSer as defined by the TAG codon. Input requirements: Supplementary Data 1 file with "K" appended to end of all <=31 aa phosphosite sequences; .csv MaxQuant search results using .raw files uploaded to Proteomexchange ID PXD008707
